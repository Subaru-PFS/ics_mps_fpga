WARNING: [Place 30-575] Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	block_design_i/mig_7series_0/u_block_design_mig_7series_0_0_mig/u_ddr3_clk_ibuf/diff_input_clk.u_ibufg_sys_clk (IBUFDS.O) is locked to IOB_X1Y76

Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.

INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 8 threads
WARNING: [DRC PLCK-23] Clock Placer Checks: Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. 
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

INFO: [Common 17-349] Got license for feature 'Implementation' and/or device 'xc7k325t-ffg900'
INFO: [Common 17-1223] The version limit for your license is '2017.08' and will expire in -7 days. A version limit expiration means that, although you may be able to continue to use the current version of tools or IP with this license, you will not be eligible for any updates or new releases.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Vivado 12-1790] Evaluation License Warning: This design contains one or more IP cores that use separately licensed features. If the design has been configured to make use of evaluation features, please note that these features will cease to function after a certain period of time. Please consult the core datasheet to determine whether the core which you have configured will be affected. Evaluation features should NOT be used in production systems.

Evaluation cores found in this design:
    IP core 'block_design_axi_ethernet_0_0' (bd_f793) was generated with multiple features:
        IP feature 'eth_avb_endpoint' was enabled using a design_linking license.
        IP feature 'tri_mode_eth_mac' was enabled using a bought license.
    IP core 'block_design_axi_ethernet_0_0' (bd_f793) was generated with multiple features:
        IP feature 'eth_avb_endpoint@2015.04' was enabled using a design_linking license.
        IP feature 'tri_mode_eth_mac@2015.04' was enabled using a bought license.
    IP core 'bd_f793_mac_0' (bd_f793_mac_0_support) was generated with multiple features:
        IP feature 'eth_avb_endpoint@2015.04' was enabled using a design_linking license.
        IP feature 'tri_mode_eth_mac@2015.04' was enabled using a bought license.

Resolution: If a new IP Core license was added, in order for the new license to be picked up, the current netlist needs to be updated by resetting and re-generating the IP output products before bitstream generation.
